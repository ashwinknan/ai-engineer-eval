# AI Engineer Assessment: Smart Game Asset Pipeline

## Objective
In the interview, you will build a Python tool that analyzes game assets from the game_assets.json file. 

## Prep needed for interview

Go through the dataset structure properly. In your interview, we will ask you to do tasks such as: 
- Parse the provided JSON file containing game asset metadata
-  Identify assets that need optimization based on defined criteria
- Optimization Suggestions Recommend specific actions for each problematic asset

The actual problem statement and specs will be described in the interview. 

## API Keys
If needed, do set up a limited use API key in an .env file for:
- OpenAI GPT-4
- Anthropic Claude

 The keys will be provided in the interview if your approach requires one. 

## Files Provided
- `game_assets.json` - Sample asset database (150+ assets)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (you can chose to add anything else that you need to)
- `README.md` - This document

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, well-structured Python
- **Problem Solving**: How you break down and tackle the requirements
- **AI Integration**: Thoughtful use of AI where appropriate (or solid rule-based logic)
- **User Experience**: Intuitive CLI design and clear output
- **Extensibility**: How easy it is to add new features during live session

## Submission
You don't need to submit anything. Just be prepped so that we can use the interview time efficiently. 

Good luck! Focus on creating a tool that a game developer would actually want to use.
